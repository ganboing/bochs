 Coming!</b></font><BR>

This page describes the latest progress as we move toward releasing Bochs 2.0.
Please check it periodically, because it will change regularly.
<p>

</b></font><BR>
Our last release was Bochs 1.4.1 on June 23 of this year.  Since then there
has been a LOT of development activity, especially since mid-August.  Here's
a summary.
<ul>
<li> CPU optimizations boost simulation speed by around 2x. (Kevin Lawton)
<li> Bochs now supports up to 8 hard drives, or 8 CDROMs, or any combination
(Christophe Bothamy)
<li> wxWindows interface has grown so that you can edit all bochsrc 
parameters using menus and dialog boxes (Bryce Denney)
<li> Bochs can now emulate the AMD x86-64 instruction set used in their Hammer processor (Peter Tattam)
<li> Bochs can now emulate MMX instructions (Stanislav Shwartzman).
<li> Remote GDB stub support (Johan Rydberg, Stu Grossman)
<li> IN PROGRESS: Stanislav is currently working on SSE/SSE2 support.
<li> IN PROGRESS: Christophe and Bryce are working on plugin support, so that
you can compile in support for many more options and enable them at runtime.
For example, you could compile in support for 4 different gui libraries 
(X11, SDL, RFB, wxWindows) and select between them in your bochsrc.
</ul>

Process </b></font><BR>
Before the 2.0 release is finalized, a few things need to happen.  First, the
developers will declare a feature freeze, during which only bug fixes will be
added to the CVS.  This has not begun quite yet because there are a few
important features (e.g. plugins, SSE) that aren't quite ready to be merged into
the main trunk. <p>

When the feature freeze begins, we can focus on testing Bochs
in all sorts of configurations, fixing bugs, updating documentation, and
cleaning things up.  This will last until we have some confidence that the most
critical bugs have been fixed or worked around, and that Bochs will compile and
work on all supported platforms.  The documentation should cover all the new
features and options. <p>

During this time, the Source Forge bug/feature/patch trackers are very important
and very useful.  Any bug that we intend to fix before the 2.0 release should be
marked with Group="to be fixed in v2.0".  At the time of release, there will be
no more open bugs, features, or patches marked for v2.0.  All items that are
marked for v2.0 will be either fixed (and closed), or postponed by changing
their Group marking to something else like "long range goal".  Using
the bug database helps to ensure that nothing important gets forgotten. 
When you're looking at the Source Forge database, you can click on the Group
box and select just the items that are selected for v2.0.
