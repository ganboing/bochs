I checked in most parts of the Bochs web site.  Some subdirs are omitted
for various reasons.  For example the "data" directory (collection of
tech specs) and guestos directory (disk images) are not checked into 
CVS because they are so large.  If the files are big, binary, and
are hardly ever revised, what's the point of version control on them?
It will just clog up SF server and make updates take longer!

Directories included in CVS:
- docs-html              (actually a checkout of bochs/docs-html)
- images
- includes
- networking
- testing-forms


Directories not included in CVS:
- xcf             (what's that)
- doc             (updated by Michael when he does make webinst)
- screenshot      (contains screen shots)
- tmp             (misc stuff)
- data            (tech spcs)
- images/.pics    (not sure)
- images/.xvpics  (not sure)
