<b>Bochs 2.0</b> (December 21, 2002):
It's been a busy 6 months since our previous release!  Bochs is now about twice
as fast as version 1.4.1.  Also, we can now emulate MMX, SSE/SSE2, and even AMD
x86-64 instructions if you turn on the appropriate configure options.  We also
added two new graphical interfaces, SVGALIB and wxWindows.  The wxWindows
interface lets you edit all bochsrc options in a graphical form.  Macintosh
users will be happy to find binaries for MacOSX and MacOS9.  Also we now
support plugins for several platforms and cleaned up and improved the
documentation.

<B>BOCHS SOURCE</B><BR>
Because Bochs is a cross-platform application, it can be compiled for
many platforms in addition to the ones for which binaries are provided.
If your platform can run the configure script, you can use the tarball.
If you're running Linux and your system can read RPMs, you can 
build Bochs using a source RPM.  If you're compiling for Win32 with 
Microsoft VC++, the ZIP file contains sources that have already been 
configured for you so you can go directly to the compile step.  For
detailed compile instructions see the 
<a href="/doc/docbook/user/book1.htm">User Guide</a>.

</ul>
<B>NOTE:</b> We depend on volunteers to provide binaries for most platforms.
If your platform is missing, you can compile from sources or use a binary from
a previous version.  To get your binary onto our site, contact 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=185114">Bryce</a>.

 Series:</b> Bochs 1.4.1</font><BR><BR>

<b>Bochs 1.4.1</b> (June 23, 2002):
Bochs 1.4.1 is the latest release of Bochs. This version
is a maintenence release of the Bochs 1.4.x series, which premiered in Spring 2002.
 The 1.4.x series delivers features that
many people have been wishing for: booting from a CDROM, VESA BIOS Extensions,
improved networking, keyboard mapping for non-US keyboards, and a working
serial port.  You'll notice several new buttons on the GUI, copy, paste, and
snapshot, which let you copy text between the system clipboard and the Bochs
screen.  And we have a new cross-platform interface using a library called SDL
(Simple DirectMedia Layer).  Give it a spin!

<b>Bochs 1.3</b> (December 10, 2001):
Bochs 1.3 is a major upgrade release to Bochs 1.2. New features include:
<ul>
<li> add support for MacOS X (Carbon API), BeOS, and AmigaOS/MorphOS
<li> emulated NE2000 works in Linux and WinNT/2000
<li> read raw CD in Win95/98, read ISO images on any platform
<li> in WinNT/2000, reading from raw floppies is supported
<li> debugger is supported on win32
<li> new text mode configuration menus, as an alternative to editing .bochsrc
<li> runtime configuration menu can change floppy disk images, turn debug logging on/off during simulation
<li> polite panics.  If you write "panic: action=ask" in the bochsrc, bochs
     will ask you what to do when a panic occurs.  Choices include: quit,
     continue, or turn off this type of message.
<li> parallel port emulation
<li> new and improved model of PIT (programmable interval timer)
<li> improved control over simulation time: option to stay in sync with real time, and an option to use less CPU time when Bochs is idle.
<li> many small improvements in cpu and device emulation
<li> simpler Win32/VC++ compile process, option to use VC++ workspaces
<li> documentation is about 80% converted to docbook, with many sections
     written from scratch.

<B>BOCHS DOCUMENTATION</B><BR>
The Bochs documentation is in the process of being converted to Docbook.  Since
this transition is not yet complete, the old HTML documentation is still
included in all source and binary distributions of 1.3.  For now, the
new documentation is in a separate package, which you can download here.
Of course, you can still read the <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?name=Bochs+Help+Documents&url=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/docs-html/">old documentation</a> or 
<a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?name=New+Bochs+Documentation&url=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook">new documentation</a> online.

Snapshot</b></font><BR><BR>

<b>CVS Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses CVS (Concurrent Version
System) to keep track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the
CVS version of the sources contains everything the developers have written
to this date, and it can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the
CVS version of Bochs will have more features and bug fixes than the release,
but also it may be somewhat less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go
exploring and try out our newest code, or stick with the better-tested
release.  Since the CVS sources are always in motion, we take a snapshot each
night at some late hour after most developers should be in bed.
<BR><BR>

<!--#include virtual="cvs-snapshot/bochs-snapshot-links.html" -->

The CVS snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using CVS itself.  Some of the benefits of
using CVS directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "cvs diff -u".
