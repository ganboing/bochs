Nine months after the last intermediate one  and the <b>switch to SVN version control</b>
we have a new stable release. Here is the summary of changes :

<ul>
<li> <b>Fully configurable CPU to emulate with a single .bochsrc option !</b>
<li> 10% (ST) to 50% (SMP) CPU emulation speedup !
<li> Implemented support for new x86 ISA extensions, Bochs is aligned with
  latest published Intel Architecture Manual (rev 040, AVX rev 011):
<li> XSAVEOPT, AVX/AVX2/FMA/F16C, BMI1/BMI2, SMEP, INVPCID, TSC-Deadline
<li> VMX: VMX Preemption Timer, Pause Loop Exiting and VM Functions
<li> Implemented support for AMD SSE4A/XOP/FMA4/TBM instruction sets
<li> Networking: introduced new networking module 'slirp'
<li> Harddrive: fixed buffer overflow causing Bochs crash in LBA48 mode
<li> VGA: Added PCI ROM support to cirrus and pcivga and moved ROM loading
  for the ISA case to the vga code (SeaBIOS now usable by Bochs)
<li> Sound: ported ES1370 soundcard emulation from Qemu
<li> Continuing configure rework, check for more removed configure and .bochsrc
  options and their replacements !
<li> LGPL'd VGABIOS updated to version 0.7a
</ul>

The binary packages for Linux and Windows are built with these featues :
<ul>
<li> x86-64 emulation with all optimizations enabled
<li> devices:
 <ul>
 <li> chipset: PCI, ACPI
 <li> video: Bochs VBE and Cirrus SVGA
 <li> sound: SB16
 <li> network: NE2000 (ISA/PCI)
 <li> USB: OHCI, UHCI and 6 device types
 </ul>

Snapshot</b></font><BR><BR></a>

<b>SVN Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses SVN (Subversion) to keep
track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the SVN version of the
sources contains everything the developers have written to this date, and it
can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the SVN version of Bochs will
have more features and bug fixes than the release, but also it may be somewhat
less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go exploring and try out our
newest code, or stick with the better-tested release.

<!--#include virtual="svn-snapshot/bochs-snapshot-links.html" -->

The SVN snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using SVN itself.  Some of the benefits of
using SVN directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "svn diff -u".
