Bochs 2.6.2 is a bugfix release. Here is the list of changes :

<ul>
<li>CPU
  <ul>
  <li>VMX: implemented VMENTER to non-active guest state (HLT, SHUTDOWN, WAIT-FOR-SIPI)
  <li>VMX: fixed write of guest segment access rights VMCS fields (32-bit field was truncated to 16-bit)
  <li>CPUID: Don't report Architectural Performance Monitoring in CPUID.
      Reporting true capabilities without actually supporting them breaks Win7 x64 installation.
  <li>CPUID: Fixed bx_generic CPUID std leafs (all std leafs > 2 were corrupted)
  <li>CPUID: Enable all supported VMX capabilities for bx_generic CPUID configuration.
  <li>CPUID: Enable X2APIC support for Ivy Bridge CPUDB configuration.
  </ul>
<li>Configure and compile
  <ul>
  <li>Enabled VMX compilation by default in shortcut scripts.
  <li>Allow CPU_LEVEL=5 configurations (pentium_mmx and amd_k2_chomper) even when Bochs was
      compiled with CPU_LEVEL > 5.
  </ul>
<li>Misc
  <ul>
  <li>Fixes for Bochs port on MorphOS (based on a patch by Thore Sittly):
      missing functions, byte-swapping and cdrom support.
  </ul>
</ul>

The binary packages for Linux and Windows are built with these featues :
<ul>
<li> x86-64 emulation with all optimizations enabled
<li> devices:
 <ul>
 <li> chipset: PCI (i430FX / i440FX), ACPI
 <li> video: Bochs VBE, Cirrus SVGA and Voodoo1
 <li> sound: SB16 (ISA) and ES1370 (PCI)
 <li> network: NE2000 (ISA/PCI) and E1000 (PCI)
 <li> USB: OHCI, UHCI, xHCI and 7 pluggable device types
 </ul>
<li> Display libraries:
 <ul>
 <li> Linux: nogui, rfb, sdl, term, wx, x
 <li> Windows: nogui, rfb, win32
 </ul>
</ul>

<b>SVN Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses SVN (Subversion) to keep
track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the SVN version of the
sources contains everything the developers have written to this date, and it
can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the SVN version of Bochs will
have more features and bug fixes than the release, but also it may be somewhat
less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go exploring and try out our
newest code, or stick with the better-tested release.

The SVN snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using SVN itself.  Some of the benefits of
using SVN directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "svn diff -u".
