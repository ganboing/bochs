<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.plex86.org">Plex86</a> is an extensible open source PC
virtualization software program which will allow PC and workstation users to run
multiple operating systems concurrently on the same machine.  Plex86 will
achieve much higher emulation speeds than bochs, but only runs on an Intel
x86 or compatible.

<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com">Vmware</a> is a commercial virtual PC type system for Linux and
Windows-based PC's. It is similar to Plex86 in nature.

<li><a href="http://www.netraverse.com">Win4Lin</a> is another commercial virtual PC implementation
designed specifically for running Windows 95 or 98 inside a window. It's faster and cheaper than
vmware, but lacks the ability to run operating systems other than Windows 9x.

<li><a href="http://www.winehq.com">WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator)</a> is creating
an implementation of the Win32 API's for POSIX-based operating systems. The project says it currently
has 90% of the API's implemented. WINE is open source software licensed under a BSD-style
license.

<li><a href="http://www.connectix.com">Connectix Virtual PC</a> is still another commercial virtual
PC implementation, available for Windows and MacOS. It is said to be faster than vmware.

<li><a href="http://www.simics.com">Simics</a> is a commercial simulator
that can target IA32, IA64, Sparc V9, and Alpha architectures.  They
have 30-day evaluation licenses available.

<li>See the <a href="http://www.plex86.org/links.phtml">plex86 links page</a>
for more sites.  They have a great collection!
