test10-modvirtual

Create an interface class in modules.h called DeviceInterface.  Each module
creates a child class of DeviceInterface, and implements its methods.  This
test loads the modules, calls the module's module_init() which instantiates a
subclass of DeviceInterface and returns a pointer to it.  Then main can call
operate on this object using the DeviceInterface class.
