test6-execsymbols2

Try again to allow the module to reference symbols in the executable. 
But this time, eliminate direct symbol references from the executable 
to the module, so that the executable can be linked first.  I believe
this will work ok for win32 and it's closer to how plugins need to work.

What I think I learned from test5:
> DLLs don't allow any symbols to be undefined at link time.  So you have to
> choose the order of how to build things so that each link is complete.
> For a DLL that's used as a shared library, it must be built and linked on
> its own (without the program), with symbols exported.  This link must be
> complete, so it can't depend on pieces from the program.  Then, the 
> program can be linked with the DLL, with the program reading symbols from
> the DLL.  It can't go both ways.
> 
> For a plugin environment, we want the plugin to be able to call functions
> in the main code, without putting every single thing as a function pointer.
> So the main executable should be built first, with appropriate symbols 
> exported, and then the plugin can import those symbols.  The main 
> executable will find symbols in the DLL using lt_dlopen() and lt_dlsym(),
> which probably maps to LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress().
