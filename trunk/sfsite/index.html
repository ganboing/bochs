 <BR><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#1e029a" size="4"><b>Welcome to the Bochs IA-32 Emulator Project</b></font><BR>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bochs is a highly portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in
 C++, that runs on most popular platforms. It includes emulation of the Intel x86 CPU, common I/O
 devices, and a custom BIOS. Currently, bochs can be compiled to emulate a 386, 486 or Pentium CPU.
 Bochs is capable of running most Operating Systems inside the emulation including Linux,
 Windows&reg; 95, DOS, and recently Windows&reg; NT 4. Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton and
 is currently maintained by this project.<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bochs can be compiled and used in a variety of modes, some which are
 still in development. The 'typical' use of bochs is to provide complete x86 PC emulation,
 including the x86 processor, hardware devices, and memory. This allows you to run OS's and
 software within the emulator on your workstation, much like you have a machine inside of a
 machine. For instance, let's say your workstation is a Unix/X11 workstation, but you want to run
 Win'95 applications. Bochs will allow you to run Win 95 and associated software on your Unix/X11
 workstation, displaying a window on your workstation, simulating a monitor on a PC.

<b>Bochs 1.3.pre1</b> (November 17, 2001):
Bochs 1.3.pre1 is a pre-release of Bochs 1.3.  
 ( <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?name=Testing+Status&url=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/docs-html/changelog.html">Details</a> - <a href="<!--#include virtual="includes/release.txt" -->">Download Now</a> )
The new features in this version include:
<ul>
<li> add support for MacOS X (Carbon API), BeOS, and Amiga/MorphOS
<li> emulated NE2000 works in Linux and WinNT/2000
<li> read raw CD in Win95/98, read ISO images on any platform
<li> in WinNT/2000, reading from raw floppies is supported
<li> debugger is supported on win32
<li> new text mode configuration menus, as an alternative to editing .bochsrc
<li> runtime configuration menu can change floppy disk images, turn debug logging on/off during simulation
<li> polite panics.  If you write "panic: action=ask" in the bochsrc, bochs
     will ask you what to do when a panic occurs.  Choices include: quit,
     continue, or turn off this type of message.
<li> parallel port emulation
<li> new and improved model of PIT (programmable interval timer)
<li> improved control over simulation time: option to stay in sync with real time, and an option to use less CPU time when Bochs is idle.
<li> many small improvements in cpu and device emulation
<li> simpler Win32/VC++ compile process, option to use VC++ workspaces
<li> documentation is about 80% converted to docbook, with many sections
     written from scratch.

The Bochs community held an IRC open discussion chat on Tuesday, June
19th, 2001. We covered a large array of topics that relate to
the current happenings in Bochs (<a href="irc-20010619.html">Transcript</a>).  There is also a transcript of our last chat from May 30, 2001 <a href="irc-20010530.html">here</a>.

Networking!</b></font><BR>
Peter Grehan is the author of the NE2000 (network adapter) and serial code in
Bochs.  He is helping us out once again to improve networking support in Bochs.
Bryce Denney and Peter met to talk about how to get Bochs talking on the network
in different host operating systems.

<i>We currently need help with the following tasks:</i>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?name=Bugs+Waiting+to+be+Fixed&url=http://sourceforge.net/tracker/qmrkgroup_ideq12580ampatideq112580">PC
Hardware Gurus</a>:
Mouse, interrupt controller,
timer, IDE controller, network card, keyboard, VGA...  Most of our bug
reports and feature requests are due to incomplete C++ models of the
various PC devices.  To improve this, we need PC Hardware Gurus who know
where to find the specs for this stuff and improve the hardware models for
Bochs.  Working on models is a fun way to learn how things work, and unlike
designing a real hard disk, you can test out your changes on a real operating
system immediately!
