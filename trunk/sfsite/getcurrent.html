<b>SVN Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses SVN (Subversion) to keep
track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the SVN version of the
sources contains everything the developers have written to this date, and it
can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the SVN version of Bochs will
have more features and bug fixes than the release, but also it may be somewhat
less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go exploring and try out our
newest code, or stick with the better-tested release.

The SVN snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using SVN itself.  Some of the benefits of
using SVN directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "svn diff -u".
