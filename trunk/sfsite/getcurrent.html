 <BR><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#1e029a" size="4"><b>Previous release:</b> Bochs 2.1</font><BR><BR>

It's been nearly one year since the last stable release :
<ul>
<li>We have improved
the accuracy of the simulation in many ways, notably in the cpu, fpu, and
vga areas. 
<li>3DNow! and PNI instructions are now supported, and Bochs 
includes a new disassembler that supports all IA-32 instruction sets. 
<li>On the I/O devices side, Bochs now provides experimental PCI VGA and USB 
cards, 16550A uarts and gameport emulation. 
<li>New types of disk image can be used as harddisks : stackable, commitable or growing. Bochs can also
use VMWare 3 cow disk images.
<li>Sdl, x11, win32 and wxwindows display libraries now support
15, 16, 24 and 32 bpp color depth, and the x11 vga font is not needed
any more.
</ul>

Note that some configuration file options have been deprectated :
please update these options to the new syntax, as they're likely to be 
removed in future releases.

Snapshot</b></font><BR><BR>

<b>CVS Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses CVS (Concurrent Version
System) to keep track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the
CVS version of the sources contains everything the developers have written
to this date, and it can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the
CVS version of Bochs will have more features and bug fixes than the release,
but also it may be somewhat less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go
exploring and try out our newest code, or stick with the better-tested
release.  Since the CVS sources are always in motion, we take a snapshot each
night at some late hour after most developers should be in bed.

The CVS snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using CVS itself.  Some of the benefits of
using CVS directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "cvs diff -u".
