Snapshot</b></font><BR><BR>

<b>CVS Snapshot:</b>
Bochs, like many other open source projects, uses CVS (Concurrent Version
System) to keep track of source code.  Unlike the current release, the
CVS version of the sources contains everything the developers have written
to this date, and it can change daily (or even hourly).  As a result, the
CVS version of Bochs will have more features and bug fixes than the release,
but also it may be somewhat less stable.  You can decide if you prefer to go
exploring and try out our newest code, or stick with the better-tested
release.  Since the CVS sources are always in motion, we take a snapshot each
night at some late hour after most developers should be in bed.

<!--#include virtual="cvs-snapshot/bochs-snapshot-links.html" -->

The CVS snapshots are provided as a convenience only.  Of course, you could
also get the same information using CVS itself.  Some of the benefits of
using CVS directly are: you can get any release or version, view the log
messages that say what files were changed, and make patches very easily
with "cvs diff -u".
