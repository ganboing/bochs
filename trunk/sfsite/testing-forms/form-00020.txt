What is the date?
[5/29/2001]

What is your name?
[Bryce Denney]

What is your email address?
[bryce dot denney at bigfoot dot com]

Do you mind if your name and email address are placed on a testing results 
web page so that people with a similar setup can write to you?
   [X] Ok, put it on a web page
   [ ] No, keep my address private.

What type of hardware are you using, e.g. 500MHz Intel Celeron.
[PowerPC G4 with 384meg RAM]

What operating system are you using?  Please be specific, e.g. 
Redhat Linux 6.2 with 2.2.16 kernel.
[MacOS X, build 3K78]

What version of bochs are you using?
   [ ] compiled from version 1.0 (3/25/2000 snapshot)
   [ ] compiled from version 1.1 (bugfix1)
   [ ] compiled from version 1.1.1 (bugfix2)
   [ ] compiled from version 1.1.2 (bugfix3)
   [X] compiled from version 1.2-pre1
   [ ] I compiled it from the CVS sources from date: [__]
   [ ] other source distribution from URL: [__]
   [ ] binary distribution from URL: [__]

Please fill in the next few questions only if you compiled Bochs
yourself, as opposed to downloading a binary.

Did the configure script run ok, and detect your hardware and
operating system?
  [ ] Yes
  [ ] No, configure crashed.
  [X] No, configure ran ok but produced a bad configuration.
  [ ] No, I cannot run configure on my platform (win32 and mac).

If you used configure, what arguments did you give it?  If you used a
.conf.* script, give the name of the .conf script instead.
[
NOTE: This was done on a system that has no X windows libraries!
./configure (no args): it said it could not find X windows libraries, 
   then it set itself up for X windows anyway.  This failed of course.
   If I install X windows I'll try it again.
./configure --with-term: could not find mvaddch in any of the 
   three libraries it searched (curses, ncurses, termlib).  So I changed
   configure.in to search for waddch instead of mvwaddch, ran autoconf
   again, and it said that waddch is found in curses.  However it still
   will not build because of a few missing functions: keypad(), set_curs(),
   and nodelay().  It's only complaining about "implicit declaration" of
   these; they may actually be in the library but not the header?
./configure --with-rfb: worked great!  Not tested much though.
]

What compiler did you use?  (Please include version.)
[Reading specs from /usr/libexec/gcc/darwin/ppc/2.95.2/specs
Apple Computer, Inc. version gcc-926, based on gcc version 2.95.2 19991024
(release) ]

Did Bochs compile clean without any hacking?
  [X] Yes, once I started using RFB mode.
  [ ] No

If you had to make changes to compile, please summarize the problems you 
had or include diffs.
[./configure --with-rfb works fine
X will probably be ok if I ever install it.

End of compile-specific questions!

What guest operating system are you using inside bochs?
[4meg linux image from web site]

Are you booting from a floppy or hard disk?
  [ ] floppy image
  [ ] raw floppy drive
  [X] hard drive image
  [ ] raw hard drive         (is this even possible?)
  [ ] other [__]

Did the guest operating system boot successfully?
  [X] Yes
  [ ] No

If no, what error messages do you see on the console or in the log file?
[__]

What applications worked under this guest operating system?
[not time to run many, this machine is very slow]

What applications failed under this guest operating system?  Did the
application function incorrectly, crash Bochs, or what?  If you got a
panic, paste in the panic message that you received with some
description of what was happening at the time.
[none yet]

The remaining questions are about Bochs features that you may not have
used.  If you tried out the feature, move the X to the "works" or
"fails" column.
