Installation Information:
Giving bochs 128megs of RAM at it's disposal DOS 6.22 started up from boot 
disk and installed just fine, like any normal installation. When I went to 
install Windows 3.1 it copied all the files from the first and second disk, 
then said it was going into windows mode, and bochs died. The second time I 
tried it, it worked fine and Windows installed as normal.

Type of mouse: PS/2

Problems:
The mouse is VERY jerky and tends to go to the top or bottom of the screen 
as you try to move it around. It's almost impossible to use the mouse.

Usage details:
Did not get much use out of it due to the mouse trouble and slowness of the 
OS itself.
