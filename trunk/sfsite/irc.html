how do I get it?</b></font><BR><BR>
There are many programs that allow you to access IRC.  Just do a search for
"irc" on <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a> or your favorite
search engine, and you will find many references to it.  One site devoted to
learning how to use IRC is
called <a href="http://www.newircusers.com/">www.newircusers.com</a>.
