In this directory, I'm developing some test cases to study 
some different options for Bochs performance improvements.

ideas:

write a loop or nested loop that takes some serious computing, that takes 
  maybe 15 seconds to run
benchmark on several machines
compile with optimization and understand the assembly
reimplement with switch stmt,function pointers, etc
benchmark again to measure the overhead of switch & function calls
test on several machines
reimplement with goto *label (gcc extension) style
benchmark again to measure the overhead of switch & function calls
test on several machines

or, by working more directly with the bochs source, we can test the
performance benefit of the "cut-and-paste native code" method on 
a small scale.
