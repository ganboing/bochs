plugin-test
Bryce Denney

This is a series of simple programs that test your platform for shared 
library support.  The tests start from something trivial that should 
work everywhere, and gradually add one feature at a time, until at 
the end (not done yet) it should test all of the shared library 
features that Bochs needs to support plugins.

test1-static: build a static library and link against it
test2-dynamic: with same code, build a shared library and link against it
test3-twomodules: build 2 shared libs and link against them
test4-interdep: build 2 shared libs, one depends on the other, and link
test5-execsymbols: can a shared lib can access a symbol from the executable?
