README for bochs-testing
updated Fri Oct 11 10:36:50 EDT 2002

Bryce created this cvs area on October 11, 2002 as a place to work on
Bochs test code without cluttering up the source tree.

The first thing I plan to put here is a series of tests for shared library
support, to help figure out which platforms will be able to support plugins.
Having this code in cvs makes it very easy to distribute to all the different
places where I need to try it out.
